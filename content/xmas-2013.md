We are having Pizzapy's first ever christmas party! It'll be on Thursday, Dec. 19 at [Symph](http://sym.ph/)'s office. There will be games and of course pizza and beer! checkout this [awesome invitation](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9519501/host/christmasparty-invitation.jpg) created by one of the members.

So talks will resume next year or next month really. We've got some exciting talks that got queued so stay tuned.

Till next year, happy holidays everyone! ;)
