We are group of individuals passionate about software development. The aim is to gather once a month with volunteer speakers who will share diverse topics over some pizza and ice cold beer! ;)

# Code of Conduct

While we are all about diverse topics despite our name, we find that Python's [Code of Conduct](http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct) is a great thing to adopt and observe during the event.

The goal is to have friendly and non-hostile environment for everyone.
