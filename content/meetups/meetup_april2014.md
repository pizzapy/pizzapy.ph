**What**: Meetup  
**When**: April. 5 2014 03:00PM  
**Where**: Function Room, Handuraw Pizza, Gorordo St., Cebu City, PH

It'll be our 6th meetup and unfortunately we're to busy to make on our usual schedule of last tuesday of the month so instead we're moving it to April 5th.

Also, we finally have our meetup [page](http://www.meetup.com/PizzaPy-PH/) and you can RSVP on the upcoming event [here](http://www.meetup.com/PizzaPy-PH/events/174832262/). There's only limited spot due to limited space and as of today there's only 11 spots left so don't forget to RSVP ahead.

This month's meetup is also special since PythonPH is sponsoring the event and we have a guest from the group, Andrew Robillo, who will be speaking about SQLAlchemy.
